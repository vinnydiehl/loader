All changes to the Loader library will be logged in this file with each release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------ 1.0a1 -------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ----- Notes -----
This is a quick demo release; it could be used at this point, but there is a lot
to be added and a few kinks to be worked out.
                               -----------------

 - Goals for next release:
   - Continue work on the library.
   - Get user feedback from this demo.

                               ----- Notes -----
                              DEVELOPMENT VERSION
                               -----------------

 - New features:
   - Added the Loader.Complete() method - sets the progress to 100%.
   - Added the Loader.Decrement() method - opposite of Loader.Increment(). Sure,
     passing a negative number to Loader.Increment() does the same thing, but
     there's not much of a reason not to add this for the sake of readability.
   - Added the ability to modify the style characters directly by making them
     public variables; however, by means of a semi-ugly web of overloads, these
     can still be temporarily modified for one call of Loader.Display().
   - Added the ability to change the value of DisplayProgress at any time by
     making the boolean public. Still leaving the ability to set it in the
     constructor for now.

 - Changes:
   - Changed the demo in main.cpp to utilize these new features; it still has
     the same output as before.
   - Trying to set progress out of the range of (0..100) will now set it to the
     end of that range rather than crashing the program.
   - All of the progress displayed on the output is now aligned at the % symbol
     rather than at the beginning of the number; it looked too weird for the
     single digit numbers.

 - Source modifications:
   - The entire Loader.Display() method now uses a stringstream, rather than
     just the part that added on the progress percentage
     - Made that stringstream an ostringstream

 - Goals for next release:
   - Implement a strict mode that allows crashes the program if they try to set
     the progress out of range.
